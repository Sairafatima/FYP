# Implementation of Coffee Supplychain using Ethereum Smart Contract

This project showcases the journey of coffee beans on blockchain. 

The coffee supply chain is the sequence of activities and process  to bring raw coffee beans from coffee farms to processed coffee in markets. 

#### Problems in Existing System
---

- Currently Coffee trade mostly relies on fax machines and emails to send and recieve contracts across the globe, resulting into slower and error prone paper work.

- Blockchain can solve this by providing immutable and verifiable data sources

		
 

#### What we are providing?
---

- We have implemented smart contract addressing the issue of storing critical data necessary at different stages of supplychain and making it verifiable by all stakeholders in supplychain.


#### Application Workflow Diagram
---
![](screens/workflow.png)

#### In this application we have Six stages
---

1. Admin
2. Farm-Inspector
3. Harvester
4. Exporter
5. Importer
6. Processor

**Admin :** Admin creates new batch which is initial stage of coffee batch.

**Farm-Inspector :**  Farm-inspectors are responsible for inspecting coffee farms and updating the information like coffee family, type of seed and fertilizers used for growing coffee.

**Harvester :** Harvesters conducting plucking, hulling , polishing , grading and sorting activities, further updating the information of crop variety, temperature used and humidity maintained during the process.

**Exporter :** Exporters are the organization who exports coffee beans throughout the world. Exporter  adds quantity, destination address, ship name, ship number , estimated date and time and exporter id.

**Importer :** Importers imports the coffee from coffee suppliers and  updates quantity, ship name, ship number , transporters information, warehouse name, warehouse address and the importer's address.

**Processor :** Processors are the organizations who processes raw coffee beans by roasting them on particular temperature and humidity and makes it ready for packaging and to sale into markets. Processor adds the information like quantity, temperature , roasting duration , internal batch number , packaging date time, processor name and processor address.

#### Deployment Steps:
---
**Setting up Ethereum Smart Contract:**

```
git clone https://github.com/imperialsoftech/coffee-supplychain-ethereum
cd coffee-supplychain-ethereum/
```

**Update truffle.js **

```
var HDWalletProvider = require("truffle-hdwallet-provider");
module.exports = 
{
    networks: 
    {
	    development: 
		{
	   		host: "localhost",
	   		port: 8545,
	   		network_id: "*" // Match any network id
		},
    	rinkeby: {
    	    provider: function() {
		      var mnemonic = "steel neither fatigue ...";//put ETH wallet 12 mnemonic code	
		      return new HDWalletProvider(mnemonic, "https://rinkeby.infura.io/8U0AE4DUGSh8lVO3zmma");
		    },
		    network_id: '4',
		    from: '0xab0874cb61d.....',/*ETH wallet 12 mnemonic code wallet address*/
		}  
    }
};
```

Go to your project folder in terminal then execute :

```
rm -rf build/
truffle compile 
npm install truffle-hdwallet-provider
truffle migrate --network rinkeby reset
```
**Please note:**
1. After successfully deployment you will get response in bash terminal like below

```
- From above responce copy address of SupplyChainStorage, SupplyChainUser, CoffeeSupplyChain
- This 3 address we need to paste in [coffee-supplychain-ui/js/app/app.js] file
like below
```
    var globIcoAddress = {
		'CoffeeMain': "0x668167b434907e2e212cb7cb7d496159c90b41a4",
		'CoffeeUser': "0x03f72d93e07428dbfbdff8f54676c19dd4421e2b",
		'Storage': "0xe544a8f280e4cb111589f935c483cafb1c6044d0"
	};

![](screens/Batch-Details-complited.png)

###### Batch work in progress
![](screens/coffeeSupplychain-inprogress.png)

- In View Batch Page,/ admin will be able to see the progressive information of coffee batch. 
- Here we can get all details of each stage and also the name and address of user who updated the particular stage. 
---

#### User Dashboard
---
![](screens/user.png)

#### User Activities
---
##### Update User Profile
![](screens/user-update-user.png)

- To update , user profile you can use Update Profile form where you have to fill the information of user like full name of user, his / her contact number and profile image of user. 
- In this form role of user and user status can only be modified by admin, user can not edit this information.

###### Batch Updation by Farm-inspector
![](screens/perform-farm-inspection.png)

- To submit the farm inspection information, user’s having role of Farm inspector will be able to see the update button in batch overview.
- By pressing on update button farm inspector can update information by providing Type of Seed, Coffee Family and Fertilizer Used. 
- After successful submit of farm inspectors information batch progress to next step which is harvesting.

###### Batch Updation by Harvester
![](screens/perform-harvesting.png)

- Harvester grows coffee beans and after complete nourishing of coffee beans harvester makes the bean ready to export by updating Coffee Variety, Temperature and humidity to blockchain.

###### Batch Updation by Exporter
![](screens/perform-exporting.png)

- Exporters sends the raw coffee beans for further process on beans as per demands and they update their own information to blockchain. 
- Once the coffee beans are ready to export, Users having role of Exporters updates the information of Exporting.
- It includes quantity, destination address, ship name, ship number , estimated datetime and exporter id.  
- By pressing submit button on the form, exporting information gets stored on blockchain.

###### Batch Updation by Importer
![](screens/perform-importing.png)

- Warehouses and Organizations who process on raw beans imports the raw coffee beans. While importing coffee beans they have to update their information on blockchain.
- Information of Quantity, Ship Name, Ship Number, Transporter Information, Warehouse Name , Warehouse Address and Importer’s Id Number. 
- After importing coffee beans, it goes for processing stage.

###### Batch Updation by Processor
![](screens/perform-processing.png)

- At last the Processors have to update the processing information like roasting temperature of coffee and get issued the quality certificate, coffee gets ready to sale out in markets.
- Processing have to fill the information of quantity, temperature, time for roasting, internal batch number, packaging date, processor name and address of processor. 
- And this is how the Coffee Supply Chain completes for one batch.

---

In this way, we can track the progress of coffee bean after each stage in blockchain. 

The stages which are yet not updated in blockchain are denoted using cross sign and the stages which are completed are denoted by right tick sign. 

You can also find out the name, address and contact information of user who updated the particular stage in coffee supply chain.
